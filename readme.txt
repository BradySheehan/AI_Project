Given a set of texts, can we correctly identify the author of each? Current approaches exist to perform authorship attribution. For this project, we would like to compare the accuracy of some known approaches for authorship attribution to the accuracy afforded by a deep neural network. We will use data obtained from the Project Gutenberg digital library. We will use techniques from natural language processing for preparing the data for training with the neural network. The neural network will be implemented using the Neural Network Toolbox in MATLABs
